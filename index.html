              <h3 class="about-titles">Mission</h3>
              <p>
                The Black Student Union at Interlake High School envisions a school community where Black students feel fully welcomed, valued, and empowered to thrive. In a school with a small Black student population, BSU exists as a space of belonging—one where students can connect with others who share similar experiences and feel affirmed in their identities. Our vision is for every Black student at Interlake to feel seen, supported, and confident in their presence within the school community.
              </p>
              <p>We imagine an environment where Black students are free to express themselves authentically, engage in meaningful dialogue, and build lasting relationships rooted in trust and understanding. BSU strives to be a place where students are uplifted academically, socially, and culturally, while developing a strong sense of pride in their identity.</p>
              <p>Central to our vision is representation. We envision Black students having access to role models who look like them and reflect the many paths to success they can pursue. By witnessing Black excellence across professional, creative, and leadership spaces, students are empowered to dream boldly and without limitation.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the Interlake BSU envisions a future where Black students do more than exist—they belong, lead, and thrive with confidence and purpose.</p>

              <h3 class="about-titles">Vision</h3>
              <p>The mission of the Black Student Union at Interlake High School is to foster a supportive and empowering space that nurtures community, representation, and opportunity for Black students. We are committed to creating an environment where members feel safe, respected, and encouraged to share their experiences, voices, and perspectives.</p>
              <p>BSU works to strengthen community by hosting discussions, cultural events, and social activities that promote connection and mutual support. Through intentional programming, we celebrate Black history, culture, and achievements while encouraging critical conversations about identity, equity, and social justice.</p>
              <p>A core part of our mission is to provide Black students with access to mentorship and role models who reflect their aspirations. By organizing guest speakers, workshops, and partnerships, we expose students to diverse professional, academic, and creative pathways. These experiences help prepare members to navigate both professional and casual settings with confidence, cultural awareness, and self-advocacy.</p>
              <p>Additionally, BSU is dedicated to leadership development and personal growth. We aim to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to succeed beyond high school while maintaining pride in who they are. Through community, education, and empowerment, Interlake BSU strives to ensure Black students are prepared to thrive wherever their futures lead.</p>
